## 📖 About This Project  

This website is the **culmination of my exciting journey** as an **Android Development Intern** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.  

Here, you'll find a **suite of five essential Android apps** I had the privilege to build.  
From a sleek calculator 🧮 to an intelligent QR code scanner 📷, each project was an **adventure in coding and creativity**.  

✨ I invite you to explore these applications and see the **skills and passion** I brought to my internship.
